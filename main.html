	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of an algorithm's efficiency. It quantifies how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of its input, allowing developers to compare different solutions to a problem. The ultimate goal is to find an algorithm with a low time complexity, which indicates that it can handle larger and larger datasets without a disproportionate increase in execution time. For instance, a sorting algorithm with a time complexity of \(O(n\log n)\) is considered more efficient for large inputs than one with \(O(n^{2})\), even if the latter might perform better on small datasets. Understanding time complexity is therefore critical for designing and selecting efficient algorithms that meet the performance needs of real-world applications.</p>
	<p>An algorithm with a linear <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) means that its memory usage grows directly in proportion to the size of its input, denoted as \(n\). For instance, if an algorithm takes an input of size \(n\) and creates a new array or list of the same size to store results, its space requirement scales linearly with the input. This is often the case with sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, which needs a temporary array proportional to the size of the input array during its process. While not as efficient as an O(1) constant space algorithm, a linear O(n) space complexity is a very common and acceptable characteristic for many applications, especially where storing the input or a processed version of it is a fundamental part of the problem.</p>
